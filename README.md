My repository for learning git and github!

it is a version control system. Manage code changes, documents, large websites, and other collections of information. Can see all previous versions to track down bugs.

Some Useful commands

	• Add: Track your files and changes in Git
	• Commit: Save your files in Git
	• Push: Upload Git commits to a remote repository, like Github
	• Pull: Download changes from the remote repository to your local machine; the opposite of push
